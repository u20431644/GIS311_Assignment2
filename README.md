# Welcome everyone!
GIS311 Assignment 2 repository
u20458704 - Magdelie Purchase & u20431644 - Matthew Attree

# Tools used
In the assignment we decided to use the following tools:
Streamlit - Streamlit provided us with a platform to host the application and provide a front facing application to display the data that we had investigated.
Pandas - This allowed us to use data frames and do specified operation within the data frames and to mine the data that we were looking for.
Folium - Folium allowed us to display the data with a Geocentric nature, as such, we were able to provide a map, with markers and polylines to display the routes between airports.
Altair - This allowed us to show graphs in a very easy to read and interpret graphical standard.

Other tools that were employed were data investigation, so see what patterns existed in the dataset.
# Process followed
The process followed in the project was:
Acquire the dataset.
Look for patterns in the dataset, decide what to display and what story the data should tell.
Provide a dashboard with the data displayed, for this we used Streamlit, as it is free and easily accessible.
We then created a GitHub repository, which linked to our Streamlit application to allow for live changes to happen.
Then we set about writing the code for what we wanted to display, which was a map that showed the source and destination airports, the distances between the airports, flight time, time zone differences and some metrics that would be interesting to the end user!
We had multiple iterations of the code, using small iterations to introduce new features one at a time, until we built up the final application. With each iteration we had to fix and remove certain bugs (read features) that would impact the overall application experience.
After the final version in our development (local environment) was stable, we then pushed the application to our production environment, where we hoped it would work on its first deployment, and it did!

# Breakdown of what each person contributed
Each person contributed equally to the assignment!
Magdelie contributed to the programming, specifically the charts and metrics of the application, as well as the overall design of the program.
Matthew contributed to the programming, specifically the map using folium and the routing on the map, as well as the GitHub repository.
